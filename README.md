## Problem Statement
QUANTUM DETECTIVE:CRACKING FINANCIAL ANOMALIES
we have created a model which detect financial anomalies in dataset by a hybrid QNN architecture using QFT for data preprocessing.we used pennylane library for quantum circuit simulation.Finally our code
 combines classical deep learning and quantum techniques to detect financial anomalies. It uses amplitude encoding to represent input data as quantum states, applies quantum Fourier transform (QFT) for feature extraction, and parameterized rotations for learning. The model integrates a quantum neural network (QNN) with classical layers, trained using binary cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer for classification.
 This way we leverage both the advantages of quantum and classical model.

## Instructions on running your project
PLEASE USE tensorflow version 2.11.0 and kerasversion 2.12.0 and also downgrade the python to 3.10 or lower.Please ensure that the csv fiiles in correct format containing only the time,amount and label as the columns. Also please lookout for protobuf package errror which might require a lower version.

## References
we used ai to debug and sometimes generate a code sometimes where we couldnt code with the example being application of QFT.
